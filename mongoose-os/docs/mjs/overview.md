Mongoose OS has one special pre-built firmware,
[mjs_base](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose-os/tree/master/fw/examples/mjs_base) .
This firmware contains embedded JavaScript engine, mJS.
mJS engine has extremely low flash and RAM footprint,
at a cost of not supporting some language constructs. See
[intro article](https://mongoose-os.com/blog/mjs-a-new-approach-to-embedded-scripting/)
and read [mJS project page](https://github.com/cesanta/mjs) for more
information.

Below there is Mongoose OS JavaScript API reference.
