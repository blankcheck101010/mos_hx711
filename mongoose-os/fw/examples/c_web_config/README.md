This example demonstrates creation of a custom Web UI for the firmware.
Custom Web UI shows device configuration, allows to modify it,
upload files to the device and update the firmware.

See [quick start guide](https://mongoose-os.com/docs/#/quickstart/)
on how to build and flash the firmware. Below is an example session:

```bash
mgos build        # Build the firmware
mgos flash        # Flash the firmware
mgos console      # Attach a serial console and see device logs
```
